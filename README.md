# porfolio.site
First try at creating a responsive portfolio site using HTML/CSS

## Install
Sublime Text

## Issues
- Whitespace on right hand side of screen appears when HTML is loaded onto Chrome
- Some confusion around the .headerLogo class for responsive sizing, must revisit and optimise 
- Return to optimise responsiveness of .headerImage 
- Revisit responsiveness of featured projects, change from vertical stacking to horizontal when screen width is greater than 700px

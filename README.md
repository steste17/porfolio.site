# porfolio.site
First try at creating a responsive portfolio site using HTML/CSS

## Install
Sublime Text

## Important Mentions
- All photos where taken from https://www.pexels.com/, a free stock image site
- Logo image courtesy of Hatchful Free Logo Design

## Issues
- [ ] Whitespace on right hand side of screen appears when HTML is loaded onto Chrome
- [ ] Some confusion around the .headerLogo class for responsive sizing, must revisit and optimise 
- [ ] Return to optimise responsiveness of .headerImage 
- [ ] Revisit responsiveness of featured projects, change from vertical stacking to horizontal when screen width is greater than 700px
